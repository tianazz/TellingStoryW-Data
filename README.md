## About me
> Lean in. 

This is *Tiana Zhu*. Welcome to my world. 

I am a graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College. Holding great passion in data science, I aim to become a data scientist and use data to solve real world problems and do social goodness. Attracted by the charisma of data science and machine learning, I not only strive in private field, working as a data science intern to find business opportunies and generate benefits for *DIDI*, *eBay* and *CashApp* but I am also active in the public field, applying data analytics skills to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. 

Graduting in May 2023, I am actively looking for 2023 full time Data Scientist opportunies!

## What I hope to learn
As a data scientist, it is important to master all the technical tools and know how to tell a good story at the same time. In a team, data scientists need to have the business sense and technical git and know how to communicate with product managers and supervisors when we want to present our insights and conclusions. Good data visualizations and presentations help us prove our point and show the problems/opportunies more easily. Therefore, with the goal of becoming a *better* data scientist, I want to improve the data visualization skill and tell a good story with data. 

Also, This class uses Tableau to visualiza data which I think can help me master this tool. Even though more and more new data visualization tools are used in nowadays workforce, the essence of data visualization is similiar. I hope to brunsh up on my Tableau techniques in this class, too.

General Government Debt EDA
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

(2) Here is a line chart about debt-to-GDP ratio of different countries in the world.

How were countries across the world dealing with sustainability of government finance in 2018?
We hightlight the top 5 countries that have the highest debt-to-GDP ratio. We can see 3 of 5 are from Europe.

#### Original visualization:

This is a visualization in a 2022-10-19 released report from Statistics Canada whose name is <Victims of police-reported family and intimate partner violence in Canada, 2021> . I am using the chart because I am concerned about the severeness of domestic violence and since the onset of Covid 19 in 2020, increased attention has focused on the issue of domestic violence due to the quarantine, lock-down and the social distancing policy. It is important to raise public awareness on the safety of individuals living in absuisve situations and take action to fight against domestic violence. 

#### Redesign final version
