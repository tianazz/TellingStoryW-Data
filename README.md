## About me
> Lean in. 

This is *Tiana Zhu*. Welcome to my world. 

I am a graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College. Holding great passion in data science, I aim to become a data scientist and use data to solve real world problems and do social goodness. Attracted by the charisma of data science and machine learning, I not only strive in private field, working as a data science intern to find business opportunies and generate benefits for *DIDI*, *eBay* and *CashApp* but I am also active in the public field, applying data analytics skills to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. 

Graduting in May 2023, I am actively looking for 2023 full time Data Scientist opportunies!

## What I hope to learn
As a data scientist, it is important to master all the technical tools and know how to tell a good story at the same time. In a team, data scientists need to have the business sense and technical git and know how to communicate with product managers and supervisors when we want to present our insights and conclusions. Good data visualizations and presentations help us prove our point and show the problems/opportunies more easily. Therefore, with the goal of becoming a *better* data scientist, I want to improve the data visualization skill and tell a good story with data. 

Also, This class uses Tableau to visualiza data which I think can help me master this tool. Even though more and more new data visualization tools are used in nowadays workforce, the essence of data visualization is similiar. I hope to brunsh up on my Tableau techniques in this class, too.

### General Government Debt EDA
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. 

(1) Bar chart
<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6SmY" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6SmY" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2021</a></iframe>

(2) Here is a line chart about debt-to-GDP ratio of different countries in the world.
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11722621"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

### How were countries across the world dealing with sustainability of government finance in 2018?
We hightlight the top 5 countries that have the highest debt-to-GDP ratio. We can see 3 of 5 are from Europe.

### Comparison
Line charts are very useful when we want to show the trends but they can be difficult to read or to use in comparisons when there are many countries.There is so much information in the grid line charts that we don't know what to focus. Bar charts work well when we want to make comparisons but it's hard to include the trend. For my chart, I use a radial map to show the data in a hireachy way. I tried to show the country data grouped in each continent. I think hireachy charts are useful when we want to show the nested relationships and make comparison as a whole. Since it also has the drawback that cannot tell a trend, I used data only from one year. 



> ## Assignment 2 

First solution:

![3533d9b5e73e23915421c904a733205](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108914292/201822963-d23ef55f-e9e9-48e7-b5f3-bd6330c42824.jpg)

Because based on the critique method I conclued that the color palette should be changed and the chart title should be added, I made these main changes in the redesign version 1. To conquer the redundance of colors and make two groups clear, I used blue and green as family violence and intimate violence and their gradient colors to show the different genders. 

Also, as the article emphasized that family violence and intimate violence have kept increasing since 2016, I want the audience to focus on the increasing part, too. Therefore, I used a dashed line for data points before 2016 and a thick line after 2016. 

In this redesign version 1, I didn't change the line chart itself but still I want to emphasize that female victims in both family violence and intimate violence outnumbered its counterpart. Therefore, I made the female victims bold in the legend. 


### Step 4 Feedback
1. Student, age 20-25

> Q1: Can you tell me what you think it is? 

A line chart showing the number of different policy reported violence over the year.

> Q2: is there anything you found confusing? Or surprising?

I don't understand very clearly what those terms on the legend means. What is intimate violence and how is that different from family violence?

> Q3: can you describe to me what this is telling you?

The number of female victims for both family violence and intimate violence have been increasing since 2016, while the number of male victims seem to be simiar each year. Also, the number of female victims is 3-4 times larger than the number of male victims each year. 

> Q4: who do you think is the intended audience for this? 

The public, policy makers.


2. Student, age 25-30

> Q1: Can you tell me what u think it is?

A line chart that depicts the trend of the soaring number of victims.

> Q2: is there anything you found confusing? Or surprising?

I noticed that it took some time to figure out what each label (of the six lines) really means. At first glance I was like "are there 6 variables in this visualization?" then I need to read the labels one by one to then realize that it is a grouping based on gender and type of violence (?)

> Q3: can you describe to me what this is telling you?

The line chart appears to depict a rising trend in recent years (based on the apparent title). In addition to that, the existence of numerous lines suggests that the chart also wants to give a separate trend on certain classifications.

> Q4: who do you think is the intended audience for this?

Perhaps for the general population because I don't see any specificity, implying that this information might be utilized by a variety of entities.

3. Adult, age 45-50

> Q1: Can you tell me what you think it is? 

A chart showing the trends from 2009 to 2021 about the different categories of violence.

> Q2: is there anything you found confusing? Or surprising?

Nothing confusing but also nothing interesting.

> Q3: can you describe to me what this is telling you?

Since 2016, the number of violence has increased. I think it is probably due to stagnated economy.

> Q4: who do you think is the intended audience for this? 

Sociologists, government officials, adults.



4. student, age 20-25

> Q1: Can you tell me what you think it is? 

A chart about statistics on the number of victims in intimate relationships/marriage. 

> Q2: is there anything you found confusing? Or surprising?

At the first place, it confuses me at whether family violence includes intimate violence. We can see that it's not the case but it is very easy to mess them up by giving a first glance. I think the categories here are very detailed(family&intimate) but more definitions on these two categories are needed for people not in the research field. 

Also, 4 colors make people hard to tell the difference between the number of female victims and the number of male victims.

> Q3: can you describe to me what this is telling you?

The number of female victims in both categories of violence is larger than the number of male victims each year.

> Q4: who do you think is the intended audience for this? 

Readers of sociology papers. 


### Step 5 solution

#### Original visualization:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108914292/201823232-7c8d847c-4b57-4bd8-9678-19733788d349.png)

Source: [https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221019/dq221019c-eng.htm](url)

This is a visualization in a 2022-10-19 released report from Statistics Canada whose name is <Victims of police-reported family and intimate partner violence in Canada, 2021> . I am using the chart because I am concerned about the severeness of domestic violence and since the onset of Covid 19 in 2020, increased attention has focused on the issue of domestic violence due to the quarantine, lock-down and the social distancing policy. It is important to raise public awareness on the safety of individuals living in absuisve situations and take action to fight against domestic violence. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the critique method and all the feedbacks, I changed the line chart to a stacked area chart. The stacked area chart not only shows the trend of the number of victims but also shows different proportions of female victims and male victims. Area chart does a better job than the line chart in showing female victims outnumber male victims very much. Also, I realized common readers tended to be confused about the definitions of family violence and intimate violence so I added a note about this. To keep the number of used colors at the minimum, I used red and blue for female and male. To make the chart clear and not messy, I put the two female parts together and other two male parts together. At last, I added an annotation line for emphasizing that from 2015, the total number of victims in domestic violence started increasing.
