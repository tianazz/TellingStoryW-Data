This is *Tiana Zhu*. Welcome to my world. 

I am a graduate student from Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College. Holding great passion in data science, I aim to become a data scientist and use data to solve real world problems and do social goodness. Attracted by the charisma of data science and machine learning, I not only strive in private field, working as a data science intern to find business opportunies and generate benefits for *DIDI*, *eBay* and *CashApp* but I am also active in the public field, applying data analytics skills to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.

## What I hope to learn
As a data scientist, it is important to master all the technical tools and know how to tell a good story at the same time. In a team, data scientists need to have the business sense and technical git and know how to communicate with product managers and supervisors when we want to present our insights and conclusions. Good data visualizations and presentations help us prove our point and show the problems/opportunies more easily. Therefore, with the goal of becoming a *better* data scientist, I want to improve the data visualization skill and tell a good story with data. 

Also, This class uses Tableau to visualiza data which I think can help me master this tool. Even though more and more new data visualization tools are used in nowadays workforce, the essence of data visualization is similiar. I hope to brunsh up on my Tableau techniques in this class, too.
