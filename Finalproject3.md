 

# Changes I made after Part 2
First, I want to thank all my interviewees for giving me so many helpful and meaningful feedbacks. After reading their comments, I made it clear that my audience for the final data story is normal adults/the public. Therefore, I added many background information and explanation to my story. I explained how my report was conducted, where the data is from. I wanted to make sure that my audience know that what kind of popular video games are researched on in my story. Instead of putting the terminologies in the visualization, I created a single page talking about these terminologies for clarity. 

For the format/design of the story, I changed how I would tell my story. Instead of giving the conclusion in the end, I moved what I wanted to convey to the beginning and used the data and the visualization to prove my point and finally reinforced my conclusion, with the intention of trying to attract my audience at the beginning. Based on the suggestions from my interviewees, I also kept the overall colors under 3 colors and in the similar color palette to be simple and not misleading. 

For the visualizations, I found out that pie charts are not appealling and easy to read for audience, therefore I removed the pie chart with column charts/bar charts to show the different proportions of population. I also added annotations to mark the 50% line for readability. When showing the top genres with more sexualization, I used  a circle map. To make it easy to read, I highlighted the top 2 genres and grayed the rest according to the suggestions from my interviewees. Since my conclusion is that the gender representation is improving, I added a line chart showing the overall trend of # of sexualized characters. What's more, there are also feedbacks about how my old titles were useless and cannot convey new information. Based on these, I changed all the titles into what I want my audience to know in the first place or what I wanted to highlight.
