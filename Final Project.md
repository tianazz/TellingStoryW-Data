## Project Part 1

### Summary 
In this project, I will be looking into the gender representation in video games. As we all know, we are consistently making efforts on achieving gender equality and fighting against sexism. Culture, in this process, plays an important role of cultivating how the society views the gender roles and therefore, I am interested that, for video games, the popular entertainment method amoung young people, how gender representation is like, is it penetrating the sexualization on women or is it improving?

#### Outline
- Introduce the booming video game industry has mega user base, mostly children and young people
- Examine the gender representation in popular games from 2012 to 2022
  - number of male/female playable characters 
  - number of male/female protagonists
  - age range for male/female characters
  - sexualization on female characters
- Conclusion on whether the video games are improving the gender representation
- Advocate for more progress

I hope people will be aware that there exists the inappropiate gender representationn in games and this is not helpful for eliminating gender sterotypes and stopping sexualizing and materializing women. We should keep making progress and do more to change this.

### Data
Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/br33sa/gender-representation-in-video-games?resource=download)

This data includes three datasets which are [characters.csv](https://github.com/tianazz/TellingStoryW-Data/blob/main/characters.grivg.csv), [games.csv](https://github.com/tianazz/TellingStoryW-Data/blob/main/games.grivg.csv) and [sexulization.csv](https://github.com/tianazz/TellingStoryW-Data/blob/main/sexualization.grivg.csv), recording characters in games released from 2012 to 2022. We can see a trend from the the past decade. Note that Characters.csv includes data both from the other two datasets. Therefore, I will mainly use the characters.csv to make most of the visualizations. 

### Method
For this project, I will use Flourish and Shorthand for my visualizations and presentation making. 


## Part 2
### Wireframe/storyboard:
I use the Shorthand to make the draft. Shorthand link: [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/9IrrfaoTHL8hRQWk)

The whole draft is based on the outline written in part 1. 

### User Research/Interviews:

#### User Research Protocal:
1. What do you think it is about?
2. Is there anything confusing to you?
3. What leaves the strongest impression to you?
4. Any suggestion about telling the story?
5. Who do you think the target audience are?

#### Interviews:

- Male, 25-30 years old

Q: what do you think it is about?

A: I initially assumed this was about gender representation in game players, but I was mistaken; this is about gender representation in video games.

Q:is there anything confusing to you?

A:In general, I'm not sure what message to elaborate on from each graphic, therefore I'm not sure what narrative this storyboard is attempting to construct (what story ties one visual to another?).
- In the “Total of Characters” graphic, the non-binary and custom colors seem too similar.
- The graphical shape of Age Ranges doesn't seem to have a very clear visualization
- I don't understand the context of the type of sexualization in the last pie chart

Q: what leaves the strongest impression to you?

A: I'm not yet impressed because all I received from the current storyboard was visual with no explanation. However, I find that bar graphs are easier to understand than other types of graphs, such as pie charts.

Q: any suggestion about telling the story?

A: So far all I've seen is "what" and maybe "when" without any "why" or even "how". It would be much better if the storyboard contains the context behind the data, such as why there is a gap in representation by quoting studies that have been conducted. It may also be necessary to convey facts about the video game itself to illustrate how important this topic is to be discussed. Facts related to video games that I can think of at the moment, for example, the total number of game players, the economic/social impact of video games, and so on.

In the technical aspect, I could provide caution in the color choices. I suggest that the colors on the chart be used consistently. Furthermore, if feasible, the background color should not overwhelm the body content (you can trick it by using opacity so that it is not so conspicuous, or choose a softer background color).

Q:	who do you think the target audience are?

A: I think it may be suitable for the younger generation, who are very connected to video games.


- Female, 20-25 years old

Q: what do you think it is about?

A: I think it ilustrates the gender representation in popular video games.

Q:is there anything confusing to you?

A: Most confusing part is the content itself. I am surprised to see there were no female protagonists in popular video games in 2015, 2016 and 2022. I started to wonder what defines the selected popular games in this story. It is hard to believe this is the case.

Q: what leaves the strongest impression to you?

A: Male characters dominate the game world and male players dominate the game industry. 

Q: any suggestion about telling the story?

A: I think the sample size the story chooses is small, therefore, I tend to think the conclusion from the small sample size is not convincing. It is better for you to show how the sample games are selected for clarity and conscientiousness.

Q:	who do you think the target audience are?

A: Investors and industry analysts..


- Female, 20-25 years old

Q: what do you think it is about?

A: I think it tells a story of what female representation is like in the game industry.

Q:is there anything confusing to you?

A: Nothing particular about the content itself. But I think you can add more layers to the "gender representation" because for now, you only include information about age, and quantity but I think, it can be more various.

Q: what leaves the strongest impression to you?

A: I will say the visualization does not tell a good story because it gets me lost at what to focus on. For example, your conclusion is " the current gender representation is improving but it's not enough", you can put it right at the beginning so that we as audience, know directly what the main point/conclusion of the story. It is more eye-catching. And then you can use these charts to make your point and if you illustrate every chart clearly, the story would be complete. 

Q: any suggestion about telling the story?

A: First, I think you should give more explanation about what these popular video games are. 

Second, for the bar chart about # of total characters from 2012 to 2022, I am confused about whether you want to show the proportion changes of different gender characters or the changes of the total characters; for the stacked bar chart, I think it would be clearer to show the blue part(male) on the top and red part(female) at the bottom; for the hierachy chart, I cannot get what you try to emphasize. I am not sure whether you want to show the different population sizes or the information under the two population. 

At last, I think for each chart, you need to change the titles by one sentence that you want to convey most and use the color code to emphasize that in the chart. The current titles are boring and not informative. 

Q:	who do you think the target audience are?

A: the public
