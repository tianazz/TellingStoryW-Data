## Project Part 1

### Summary 
In this project, I will be looking into the gender representation in video games. As we all know, we are consistently making efforts on achieving gender equality and fighting against sexism. Culture, in this process, plays an important role of cultivating how the society views the gender roles and therefore, I am interested that, for video games, the popular entertainment method amoung young people, how gender representation is like, is it penetrating the sexualization on women or is it improving?

#### Outline
- Introduce the booming video game industry has mega user base, mostly children and young people
- Examine the gender representation in popular games from 2012 to 2022
  - number of male/female playable characters 
  - number of male/female protagonists
  - age range for male/female characters
  - sexualization on female characters
- Conclusion on whether the video games are improving the gender representation
- Advocate for more progress

I hope people will be aware that there exists the inappropiate gender representationn in games and this is not helpful for eliminating gender sterotypes and stopping sexualizing and materializing women. We should keep making progress and do more to change this. 

 
### Initial sketches
 Clear and understandable sketches created and available on the Github page. Sketches mimic aspects of the outline and build on message. Story structure is built into sketches.
 
### Data

TellingStoryW-Data/
This data includes three datasets which are characters.csv[https://github.com/tianazz/TellingStoryW-Data/blob/main/characters.grivg.csv](url), games.csv and sexulization.csv, recording characters in games released from 2012 to 2022. We can see a trend from the the past decade. Note that Characters.csv includes data both from the other two datasets. Therefore, I will mainly use the characters.csv to make most of the visualizations. 

### Method
For this project, I will use Flourish and Shorthand for my visualizations and presentation making.
