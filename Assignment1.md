### General Government Debt EDA
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance.

### How were countries across the world dealing with sustainability of government finance in 2018?
We hightlight the top 5 countries that have the highest debt-to-GDP ratio. We can see 3 of 5 are from Europe.

### Comparison
Line charts are very useful when we want to show the trends but they can be difficult to read or to use in comparisons when there are many countries.There is so much information in the grid line charts that we don't know what to focus. Bar charts work well when we want to make comparisons but it's hard to include the trend. For my chart, I use a radial map to show the data in a hireachy way. I tried to show the country data grouped in each continent. I think hireachy charts are useful when we want to show the nested relationships and make comparison as a whole. Since it also has the drawback that cannot tell a trend, I used data only from one year.
